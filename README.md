Trying to get the app up and running on Heroku was a disaster.

We are making a version of the famed tire company promotional pitch. The Michelin
Guide. The app is being set up in SPA format. It lists all the restaurants in the database alphabetically(sorted server side). Then you have the ability to search for all the restaurants in a specific city.

Trello workspace was very handy in parsing out tasks and keeping track of them when they were finished.

We had one massive merge conflict that set us back a bit.
